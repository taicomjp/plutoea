// Database of Additional Range and NPC Type that used by INF2_NO_NEARNPC
// <skill_name>,<additional_range>{,<npc_type>}
// ====================================================
// additional_range: If this value is 0, splash range value will be used from skill_db,
//      or if it is 0, range+layout's range from skill_unit_db. Otherwise, the range
//      will be added.
// npc_type (bitmask): 1 = warp portal, 2 = shop NPC, 4 = normal NPC script, 8 = tomb
// ====================================================
// Example:
//MG_SAFETYWALL,2
// MG_SAFETYWALL can't be placed if the ground's target is near from NPC by 2 cells
// (MG_SAFETYWALL doesn't have splash, layout range, and range value, so must add the
// 'additional_range', or it will be pointless)
//
//GS_DESPERADO,2
// GS_DESPERADO can't be casted if the caster is standing near from NPC within range
// 5 cells. (Why? GS_DESPERADO has 3 cells of splash range +2 'additional_range' here)
//
//SC_CHAOSPANIC,0,1
// SC_CHAOSPANIC can't be placed on the ground that near the warp portal with range 2
// cells. (Because SC_CHAOSPANIC doens't have splash range, it uses layout range)

SC_CHAOSPANIC,0,1
SC_MAELSTROM,0,1
